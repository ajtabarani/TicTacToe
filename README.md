# TicTacToe
Basic Tic Tac Toe game coded in Java. This is my first ever project and the first real thing I coded in the Java language. I tried to do everything on my own without looking at a tutorial for a Tic Tac Toe, but as I am new to the language I am unsure that I followed all of the proper "rules" that Java programmers follow (such as capitalization, using modifiers, etc...).
